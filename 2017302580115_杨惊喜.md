(a) Propagation delay：d<sub>prop</sub> = m/s  
(b) Transmission time：d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R  
(c) Delay：d<sub>nodal</sub> = m/s + L/R  
(d) Suppose Host A is starting transmiting the host at t=0, so at t = d<sub>trans</sub>, The last bit of the packet is just leaving A  
(e) If d<sub>prop</sub> > d<sub>trans</sub>,at t = d<sub>trans</sub>，The first bit of the packet is in propgation between A and B  
(f) If d<sub>prop</sub> < d<sub>trans</sub>,at t = d<sub>trans</sub>，The first bit of the packet is at B  
(g) Suppose d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub>，m = (Ls)/R = 1202.5×10<sup>8</sup>/56 = 535714.2857m

(a)  
First: 0  
Second: L/R   
Third: 2L/R  
Nth: (N-1)/R  
Therefore,  
d<sub>average</sub>=(L/R+2L/R+…+(N-1)L/R)/N==(N-1)L/2R  
(b) d<sub>average</sub>=(N-1)L/2R

（a）R*t<sub>prop</sub> = 2Mbpsx20000km/(2.5x108)m/s = 160000  
（b）Maximum number of bits on a link：160000 ，which is the value of bandwidth-delay product. The formula is in （e）  
（c）The bandwidth-delay product is the maximum number of bits available on any time link. The formula is in （e）  
（d）The width of one bit：Length/number = 20000km/160000 =125m ,which is larger than a pitch  
（e）Consider maximum number of bits on a link  
Suppose there are L bits total , propogation delay is m/s , transmission delay is L/R.   
Then the percentage of propagation delay to transmission delay is : (m/s)/(L/R) = mR/sL , which is after time of mR/sL , The link is full of bits.    
Since there are L bits, the maximum number of bits on any time link is : L * mR/sL = mR/s , which is the bandwidth-delay product.    
Width：m / (mR/s) = s/R
