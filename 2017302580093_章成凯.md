# Homework 2

### Question 1 

> **P25.** Suppose two hosts, A and B, are separated by 20,000 kilometers and are connected by a direct link of R=2 Mbps. Suppose the propagation speed over the link is 2.5x10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec.

> **a.** Calculate the bandwidth-delay product, R*d<sub>prop</sub>.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> R*d<sub>prop</sub> = 2 Mbps * (2.0x10<sup>7</sup> m / 2.5x10<sup>8</sup> m/s) = 2 Mbps * 8x10<sup>-2</sup> s = 1.6x10<sup>5</sup> bits

> **b.** Consider sending a file of 800,000 bits from Host A to Host B. Suppose the file is sent continuously as one large message. What is the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> Time interval between sending two bits: *dt* = 1 bit / 2.0x10<sup>6</sup> bps = 5.0x10<sup>-7</sup> s
>>
>> As: *dt* = 5.0x10<sup>-7</sup> s < d<sub>prop</sub> = 8x10<sup>-2</sup> s
>>
>> We could see that before a bit is propagated to the receiver end, the sender side has already sent the subsequent bits. 
>>
>> The bits transmits x<sub>delta</sub> = v<sub>prop</sub> * *dt* = 2.5x10<sup>8</sup> m/s * 5.0x10<sup>-7</sup> s = 125 m
>>
>> If each of bits in the link is seperated by x<sub>delta</sub>, the link can hold a maximum of n<sub>max</sub> = x<sub>link</sub> / x<sub>delta</sub> = 2.0x10<sup>7</sup> m / 125 m/bits = 1.6x10<sup>5</sup> bits
>>
>> As total number of bits to transfer is: n<sub>file</sub> = 8.0x10<sup>5</sup> bits > n<sub>max</sub> = 1.6x10<sup>5</sup> bits
>>
>> We can conclude that the **maximum** number of bits that will be in the link at any given time: n<sub>inlink</sub> = R*d<sub>prop</sub> = 1.6x10<sup>5</sup> bits, since the link will be fully occupied by file bits at some stage in the transmitting process.

> **c.** Provide an interpretation of the bandwidth-delay product.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The bandwidth-delay product R*d<sub>prop</sub> is the **maximum** number of bits that will be in the link at any given time, when the number of bits to transfer is greater than or equal to it.

> **d.** What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link? Is it longer than a football field?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The width of a bit in the link: x<sub>width</sub> = x<sub>delta</sub> = 125 m, which is longer than a football field (90-120 m).

> **e.** Derive a general expression for the width of a bit in terms of the propagation speed s, the transmission rate R, and the length of the link m.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> Referring to my answer to **sub-question b**, the general expression for the **width of a bit** in terms of the **propagation speed s**, the **transmission rate R** is: x<sub>width</sub> = s * (1 / R) = s / R

### Question 2

> **P29.** Suppose there is a 10 Mbps microwave link between a geostationary satellite and its base station on Earth. Every minute the satellite takes a digital photo and sends it to the base station. Assume a propagation speed of 2.4x10<sup>8</sup> m/s.

> **a.** What is the propagation delay of the link?

>> **My Answer:**
>>  A geostationary satellite in such an orbit is at an altitude of approximately x<sub>geo</sub> = 3.6x10<sup>7</sup> m
>>
>> d<sub>prop</sub> = x<sub>geo</sub> / v<sub>prop</sub> = 3.6x10<sup>7</sup> m / 2.4x10<sup>8</sup> m/s = 0.15 s

> **b.** What is the bandwidth-delay product, R*d<sub>prop</sub>?

>> **My Answer**
>>
>> R*d<sub>prop</sub> = 10 Mbps * 0.15 s = 1.5x10<sup>6</sup> bits

> **c.** Let x denote the size of the photo. What is the minimum value of x for the microwave link to be continuously transmitting?

>> **My Answer**
>>
>> Number of bits tranmitted each minute is n<sub>min</sub> = R * 60 s/min = 10 Mbps * 60 s = 6.0x10<sup>8</sup> bits
>>
>> Since every minute the satellite takes a digital photo and sends it to the base station, if we want it to transmitted continuously, the minimum value of x (the size of the photo) is x<sub>min</sub> = n<sub>min</sub> = 6.0x10<sup>8</sup> bits

### Question 3

> **P31.** In modern packet-switched networks, including the Internet, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller packetsand sends the packets into the network. The receiver then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this process as message segmentation. Consider a message that is 8x10<sup>6</sup> bits long that is to be sent from source to destination in Figure 1. Suppose each link in the figure is 2 Mbps. Ignore propagation, queuing, and processing delays.

<p align=center>Figure 1</p>

> **a.** Consider sending the message from source to destination **without message segmentation**. How long does it take to move the message from the source host to the first packet switch? Keeping in mind that each switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the message from source host to destination host?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The total time to move the message from source host to destination host **without message segmentation** is t<sub>noseg</sub> = n<sub>msg</sub> / R * n<sub>hops</sub> = 8x10<sup>6</sup> bits / 2 Mbps * 3 = 12 s

> **b.** Now suppose that the message is **segmented** into 800 packets, with each packet being 10,000 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from source host to the first switch? When the first packet is being sent from the first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The time to move the first packet from source host to the first switch is t<sub>0-1</sub> = n<sub>packet</sub> / R = 10000 bits / 2 Mbps = 0.005 s
>>
>> The time when the second packet be fully received at the first switch is t<sub>recv</sub> = t<sub>0-1</sub> +  t<sub>1-2</sub> = 0.005 s + 0.005 s = 0.01 s later than the time when the first packet be sent.

> **c.** How long does it take to move the file from source host to destination host when message segmentation is used? Compare this result with your answer in part (a) and comment.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The time to move the file from source host to destination host when message **segmentation is used** is t<sub>seg</sub> = (x<sub>packet</sub> + 2) * t<sub>0-1</sub> = (800 + 2) hops * 0.005 s/hop = 4.01 s
>>
>> Referring to my answer to **sub-question a**, the total time to move the message from source host to destination host **without message segmentation** is t<sub>noseg</sub> = 12 s
>>
>> It seems that the transfer time when message segmentation **is used** is far **less** than the transfer time when message segmentation **is not used**. So in this circumstance, it's better to use segmentation.

> **d.** In addition to reducing delay, what are reasons to use message segmentation?

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> Despite reducing delay, other good reasons to use message segmentation are as follows:
>>
>> First of all, without segmentation, if there is a bit error in the message, the whole message has to be retransmitted. But with segmentation, only the packet containing the error needs to be retransmitted.
>>
>> Secondly, without segmentation, if there is a huge message being processed by the router, the smaller messages coming behind it will have to wait until the whole huge message is sent away by the router. If with segmentation, the router will not be occupied by a single huge message for a unfairly long time.

> **e.** Discuss the drawbacks of message segmentation.

>> **My Answer:**
>>
>> The drawbacks of message segmentation are as follows:
>>
>> Firstly, the original message should be reconstructed precisely and intactly from the segmented packets in the receiver end without introducing errors. It is usually hard and tedious to implement such a reconstruction scheme.
>>
>> Moreover, the segmentation process will often prepend some header bits for each packet in order to mark which message it belongs to. This will increase the total number of bits needing transmission.
