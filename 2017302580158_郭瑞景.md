# Problem 12

### Solution:

Total bits to be transmitted $=4.5 * 1500 * 8 = 54000$ (bits)

Queuing delay $=54000 / 2M = 27$ (msec)

# Problem 13

### Solution:

#### a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&(0+\frac{L}{R}+\frac{2L}{R}+...+\frac{(N-1)L}{R})\\
&=\frac{L}{RN}Â·\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\\
&=\frac{L(N-1)}{2R}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### b)

Total time to transmit $N$ packets $=NL/R$ seconds. Thus the buffer is empty when another batch of $N$ packets arrive. Therefore the average queuing delay of a packet remains the same, i.e., $\frac{L(N-1)}{2R}$.

# Problem 23

### Solution:

#### a)

Soppose the first packet is A and the second packet is B.

Since the bottleneck is the first link, B is queued at the first link waiting for the transmission of A. The interval is $L/R_s$, which is also the packet inter-arrival time at the destination.

#### b)

Time needed for B to arrive at the input queue of the second link includes the time for the server sending A, the time for the server sending B, and the propogation delay: $L/R_s + L/R_s + d_{prop}$

Time needed for A to finish its transmission onto the second link includes the time for the server sending A, the propogation delay, and the time for the internal node sending A: $L/R_s + d_{prop} + L/R_c$

Since $R_s > R_c$, we have

$$
L/R_s + L/R_s + d_{prop}<L/R_s + d_{prop} + L/R_c
$$

Thus it is always true that the second packet queues at the input queue of the second link.

To ensure no queuing before the second link, we have

$$
L/R_s + L/R_s + d_{prop}+T\ge L/R_s + d_{prop} + L/R_c
$$

i.e.

$$
T\ge L/R_c - L/R_s
$$

Thus the minimum value of T is $L/R_c - L/R_s$.
