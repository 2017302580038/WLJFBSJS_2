# Homework 2

## P2

By sending single package, we have delay NL/R, then for P package, the transmisstion delay will be

```latex

PNL/R

```

## P3

### a

Circuit-switched network is more appropriate.Because the bandwidth can be reserved to maintain the communication, while the connection in this case is predictable and stable.

### b

No. Congestion control happened when the network is congested, that is, when some buffers on the link are full when a packet arrive. Since the sum of application data rates is smaller than each and every link, there will not be a congestion, so no need for congestion control.

## P4

### a

At most 16 simutaneous connections. A->B B->C C->D D->A, with each link work in full capacity.

### b

There are 2 ways to establish connections from A to C, A->B->C A->B->C, each way has 4 circuits, so there are 8 maximum connection

### c

Yes. Consider 2 circuits goes A->B->C, meanwhile 2 circults goes A->D->C, this leaves 2 circults in B->C->D and 2 in circults B->A->D, which is able to form 4 links B->D

## P8

### a

each user requires 150kbps to share a 3 Mbps link, so 3M/150k = 20, there are 20 users can be supported.

### b

for a given user, p = 0.1

### c

By binomial distribution,`P(n) = (Cn/120)*(0.1)^(n)(0.9)^(120-n)`

### d

`E(X>20) =  1- Î£_{n=0}{20} P(n) `, where `P(n)` is described above.
